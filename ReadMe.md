**Project demonstrates a line following bot, with 2 stages of development:**

**1:** Basic Tire rotation and line following logic:



&nbsp;  \* Simple direction correction based on sensor readings.

&nbsp;  \* Less stable on curves, oscillates at high speeds.



**2:** Using PID logic to improve stability and reduce oscillations by appropriate tuning.

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  \* Much more stable at higher speeds as oscillations are near invisible.

&nbsp;  \* Smoother motion.





**Technology used and skills developed:**



 **\*Arduino**



 **\*Embedded C**



 **\*IR sensors**



 **\*PID control algo -** Understanding the error calculation and appropriate correction per         		iteration of the loop to move from discrete-step corrections to continuous-		valued 	control signals.
